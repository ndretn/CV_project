# Computer Vision Final Project #

This repository contains the code of the final project of the computer vision course at the master degree in Computer Engineering of the University of Padua, Italy, academic year 2016-2017.

The aim of the project was the implementation of a face recognition technique using RGB-D data originally described in the following paper: 
Gaoli Sang, Jing Li, and Qijun Zhao. 2016. Pose-invariant face recognition via RGB-D images. Intell. Neuroscience 2016, Article 13 (January 2016).

The paper describes a technique for face recognition using RGB-D data.
In particular it uses a covariance matrix approach to represent faces and SVMs on classification phase.
